## Tasks

1. [ ] hosts
2. [ ] footprint
3. [ ] role-split
4. [ ] framework
5. [ ] agent-vllm
6. [ ] on-demand
7. [ ] two-node
8. [ ] answer

## Decisions

- setup: kind context; check `mise run check`, currency `mise run currency`, no gate; public GitHub with `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch`, no CI — copied from spike-hosting-upgrades.
- setup: held python at 3.14.10 in the bench environment: torchcodec 0.17.0, needed by GuideLLM 0.8.1's audio extra, has no cp315 wheel; declines 3.15.2.
- setup: load tool GuideLLM 0.8.1 from the laptop, its multi-turn datasets for agent sessions; anchors A and B copied into `bench/`.
- setup: gb10-2 joins the host set now (spike-ai-pipeline complete); it moves onto spike-model-engines' engines suite and shared preset, carrying spike-ai-pipeline's vision keys (ub 1120, image-min-tokens 560) by PR; spike-ai-pipeline's repo stays untouched.
- setup: spike-model-engines joins repos; its `host/` changes only through PRs citing a finding.
- setup: native features first: on-demand loading through llama.cpp's router (autoload, LRU `--models-max`, `--models-memory-margin`, `--sleep-idle-seconds`); llama-swap only in front of vLLM.
- setup: vLLM runs in containers, never bare metal (spike-model-engines `docs/findings/vllm-gb10-native.md`: within run noise, same memory, starts 137 s sooner); agent-vllm moves the pin to v0.33.0.
- setup: routing stays on paper; each workload targets its host directly; stickiness and overflow go to spike-model-gateway as requirements. Rejected: a stand-in router this spike would throw away.
- setup: role-split compares set A on one GB10 against the roles split across both GB10s (one agent-only, the other vision, audio and embedding), requests directed by capability; it absorbs the planned capability-host task. Either GB10 may take either role.
- setup: the Framework's role is chosen from role-split's findings in framework's plan round.
- setup: two-node is measured (gb10-2 available): gpt-oss-120b with vLLM and Ray in containers against one node; it weighs both GB10s pooled for the agent with the Framework serving the capability models. Rejected: llama.cpp RPC, with no documented two-node run.
- setup: docs: `docs/findings/<task>.md`, one living `docs/layout.md`, `bench/`, `scripts/` with `measure-lib.sh` copied from spike-hosting-upgrades, raw output under `.state/`.
